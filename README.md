## Article content with markdown syntax

The Hollywood Hills shimmered in the distance, a constant reminder of the life I was leaving behind. Million-dollar contracts, screaming fans, and the intoxicating allure of the red carpet â€“ it all felt like a faded dream. The truth was, the magic had dimmed. I craved a different kind of creation, something where my vision could truly take center stage. So, with a deep breath and a heart full of trepidation, I announced my retirement from acting. Trading scripts for code, I embarked on a new adventure.
```

3. Run `generateARTICLES.ts`. `ARTICLES.json` will be overwritten.
4. Run `npm start` to start the live server or...
5. Run `npm run build` to build a deployable site
6. My articles are copyright but you're welcome to copy my code.

### Feature Roadmap

-  [ ] Style the code block buttons like this [example](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/)
   -  [ ] Code wrap buttons
   -  [ ] Lovely tooltip
-  [ ] Refactor some of the repetition in some of the components.
-  [ ] Codeblock header slightly different colour
-  [ ] Create an Error page / Component
-  [ ] Style the Error page with useful Back and Home buttons
-  [ ] Add conditional loading to the article page to handle errors gracefully
-  [ ] Social icons could be prettier
-  [ ] Implement loading progress bar at the top of the page
-  [ ] Skeleton screen
-  [ ] Style the scroll bar in the theme colours (Maybe - actually this could be annoying)
-  [ ] Code wrap button on each block
-  [ ] Global dark mode button
-  [ ] Add subtle fade-in animation to each article preview when scrolling down the homepage
-  [ ] Make the (currently hidden) search bar functional
-  [ ] Organise `article.md` files into folders, ensuring they can still be read by `main.js`
-  [ ] Prevent incorrect article paths from displaying an empty page
-  [ ] Fancy bracket animation on site title. [CSS Bracket hover animation](https://codepen.io/adatg/pen/BGLVGL?editors=0100)
-  [ ] Blur link on mobile after clicking pagination links. Tried `event.target.blur()` but this didn't work. Other people on stackOverflow mention it also doesn't work for them
