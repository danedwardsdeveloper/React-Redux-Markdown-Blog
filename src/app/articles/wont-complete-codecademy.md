title: Why I won’t be completing the Codecademy Full-Stack Pathway

I invested in a year of access to Codecademy's Full-Stack Pathway, excited to land a coding job. But after diving in and using the platform every day for over 6 months, I realised it wasn't the perfect one-size-fits-all solution I'd envisioned. Here's why I'm changing my approach, and why you might consider doing the same.

### Love the Platform, but Here's the Catch

Codecademy _is_ fantastic. It's engaging, well-structured, and a fantastic introduction to coding. Their popularity (and [annual turnover](https://growjo.com/company/Codecademy)) is well-deserved. However, every tool has its limitations.

### The Certificate Trap and the Importance of Focus

The Full-Stack Pathway promises a shiny certificate at the end. Unfortunately, that certificate holds little weight in the job market. The real prize lies in developing your skills and building a strong portfolio.

Think about it - would you rather interview someone with a generic certificate (that could easily be faked or bought) or someone whose portfolio showcases their ability to solve real-world problems using the technologies companies need?

## Focus on your goals, not just completing the course

Inspired by a [School of Life YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJhUs1L_RQo), and concepts explored further in the fabulous book [What They Forgot To Teach You At School](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-They-Forgot-Teach-School/dp/1912891395), I decided to tailor my learning to my specific goals. As alluring as the prospect of seeing the course progress bar reach 100%, that won’t be happening for me.

### Key ideas from the video & book:

- **Lingering Student Mentality:** Even after formal schooling ends, people may subconsciously crave external validation and approval from authority figures. They might feel a need to follow the rules set by others instead of pursuing their own path.
- **Questioning External Measures of Success:** The School of Life critiques the idea that exams and grades are the ultimate measure of worth. They argue for finding your own internal sense of fulfilment rather than relying on external validation.
- **Embracing the Unknown:** Leaving the metaphorical school requires embracing the uncertain and messy nature of life. It's about taking risks and learning from experience rather than seeking the comfort of clear-cut rules.
- **Challenging the Myth of Complete Knowledge:** The School of Life would likely argue that this idea
- The ideas subtly perpetuated by schools (and Codecademy) that everything worth knowing is already known is not only untrue but also demotivating. It’s not true in brain science, and it’s certainly not true in computer programming. There's always more to discover, understand, invent, and build.

### Skip the Fluff, Prioritise what Matters

**I won't be completing every aspect of the course. Here's what I’ll be missing out:**

- **Useless Projects:** Some projects simply won't impress potential employers. Focus on building projects relevant to the jobs you want.
- **Broken Assessments:** Bug-infested assessments can be frustrating and a waste of time.
- **Outdated Course Material:** Codecademy can be slow to keep up with fast-paced technology (like React and Redux). Learning from official documentation might be less user-friendly, but the content is more relevant.
- **Streak Obsession:** Codecademy is highly gamified, but don't get caught up in maintaining a daily streak. Taking breaks to focus on portfolio projects is crucial if you want to be employable. And I’ll say it again: they don’t have an actual prize to offer you.

### Learn what you need, not what they teach

If you're serious about landing a coding job, delve into real job descriptions. Learn the specific technologies companies are looking for. Remember, Codecademy aims for a broad audience, not the specific needs of the job market in your area.

## Conclusion: A launchpad, not a destination

Codecademy is a valuable learning platform, and I've gained a lot, but it's not a magic bullet, and time is precious. Don't waste it on course content that doesn’t align with your goals.

**There's a whole world of coding knowledge waiting to be explored. Keep learning, keep building, and most importantly, keep your eyes on the prize - your dream coding career, or whatever you’re working towards. Don’t let Codecademy’s business objectives distort your thinking.**
