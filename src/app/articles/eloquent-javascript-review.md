This is a fantastic book, but it's not for beginners. Haverbeke clearly knows a lot about JavaScript, but could brush up on his pedagogy, as there's no way you could learn JavaScript from reading this book alone.

## Is it worth reading

Absolutely. But it's less of a quick read, and more of a work book.
